Setup:
  cmd:  yarn create react-app my-app
  cmd:  yarn add styled-components

  Git Repo:
  Remove the git repo because it is in the front end and we want it in the root
    cmd: rm -rf .git

    move the .git file into the root as well.

  cmd:  yarn add react-bootstrap

  cmd: yarn add react-router-dom
  cmd: yarn add react-router-bootstrap

  From the Root:
  cmd:  yarn init
  cmd:  yarn add express




Misc.
* Using react dev tools is good if you are using the context API, but since we are using redux, we will use the redux dev tools
