Setup:
  From the frontend:
  cmd:  yarn create react-app my-app
  cmd:  yarn add styled-components
  cmd:  yarn add axios
  cmd:  yarn add redux
  cmd:  yarn add react-redux
  cmd:  yarn add redux-thunk
  cmd:  yarn add redux-devtools-extension

  Git Repo:
  Remove the git repo because it is in the front end and we want it in the root
    cmd: rm -rf .git

    move the .git file into the root as well.

  cmd:  yarn add react-bootstrap

  cmd: yarn add react-router-dom
  cmd: yarn add react-router-bootstrap

  From the Root:
  cmd:  yarn init
  cmd:  yarn add express
  cmd:  yarn add --dev nodemon
  cmd:  yarn add --dev concurrently
  cmd:  yarn add dotenv
  cmd:  yarn add mongoose
  cmd:  yarn add colors
  cmd:  yarn add bcryptjs
  cmd:  yarn add express-async-handler
  cmd:  yarn add jsonwebtoken




Misc.
* Using react dev tools is good if you are using the context API, but since we are using redux, we will use the redux dev tools

* When you want to bring redux state into a component, you need to import useSelector from 'react-redux'
* When you want to call and action on redux state, you need to import useDispatch from 'react-redux'




TODO:
  - Review exactly what mongoose is
  - React Hooks
    - In general, what exactly is a hook?
    - useState
    - useEffect
  - When importing in react, why do some things need to be in curly braces and others dont? ie:
      "import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';
      vs.
      "import Item from '../items';

  

  BUGS:
  - if you run the server with a user already logged in via localStorage, then when you try to create an order, you get an error that says "Cannot read property '_id' of null".
  - Fix all currencies to fixed decimal place of 2
  - fix currency formatting on 
      - cart screen
      - product show screen
  - Duplicate items in cart from local localStorage
  - when clearing the database, if i register a new user with the same name as a previous user, the data pulls from local storage as if the user already existed.
  - clearing the database does not clear local storage.
